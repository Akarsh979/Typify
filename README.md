## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 (Linux and macOS support coming soon)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- 4.5GB free disk space for the AI model

### Step 1: Download and Install

1. **Clone or download the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/typify.git
   cd typify
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   # source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 2: Model Setup

The app will automatically download the required AI model on first run. This is a one-time process:

1. **First-time setup** (automatic)
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
2. **The app will:**
   - Download the Mistral-7B model (~4.1GB)
   - Set up the model in the `models/` folder
   - Initialize the configuration

### Step 3: Configuration (Optional)

You can customize Typify's behavior by modifying `config.py` or using environment variables:

#### Basic Configuration
```python
# config.py
MODEL_THREADS = 8           # CPU threads to use
CACHE_SIZE = 200           # Number of cached results
RESPONSE_TIMEOUT = 30      # Max processing time in seconds
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# For better performance
set MODEL_THREADS=16
set MODEL_GPU_LAYERS=35    # If you have a GPU

# For memory management
set CACHE_SIZE=100
```

### Step 4: Run Typify

```bash
python main.py
```

The app will:
- Start in the background
- Show a notification when ready
- Begin listening for hotkeys
- Create a system tray icon (coming soon)

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### GPU Acceleration (Recommended)
If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can significantly speed up Typify:

1. **Check GPU compatibility**
   ```bash
   python check_gpu.py
   ```

2. **Enable GPU acceleration**
   ```bash
   set MODEL_GPU_LAYERS=35
   python main.py
   ```

### Performance Tips
- **More RAM = Better Performance** - 16GB+ recommended
- **SSD Storage** - Faster model loading
- **Close Unnecessary Apps** - More resources for Typify
- **Adjust Thread Count** - Set `MODEL_THREADS` to match your CPU cores

## üîß Configuration Options

### Model Settings
```python
# config.py
MODEL_PATH = "./models/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_S.gguf"
MODEL_THREADS = 8          # Adjust based on your CPU
MODEL_GPU_LAYERS = 0       # Set to 35+ if you have a GPU
```

### Application Behavior
```python
CACHE_SIZE = 200           # Number of cached corrections
RESPONSE_TIMEOUT = 30      # Maximum wait time
AUTO_COPY = True          # Automatically copy corrected text
SHOW_NOTIFICATIONS = True  # Show completion notifications
```

### Hotkey Customization
```python
# Modify hotkeys in config.py
HOTKEYS = {
    'fix_line': 'f9',
    'fix_selection': 'f10',
    'summarize': 'f8',
    'change_tone': 'f7',
    'exit': 'ctrl+shift+e'
}
```

## üö¶ Quick Start Guide

1. **Install Python 3.8+**
2. **Download Typify**
3. **Run**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Start**: `python main.py`

6. **Start typing** and use hotkeys!

## üìä System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 10, Linux, macOS
- **RAM**: 8GB

### Recommended Requirements
- **RAM**: 16GB+
- **Storage**: SSD with 10GB+ free space
- **CPU**: 8+ cores, 3.0GHz+
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 6GB+ VRAM (optional but recommended)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't start:**
- Check Python version: `python --version`
- Verify dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check available RAM (need at least 8GB)

**Hotkeys not working:**
- Run as administrator (Windows)
- Check if other apps use the same hotkeys
- Verify Typify is running in background

**Slow performance:**
- Enable GPU acceleration
- Increase `MODEL_THREADS` in config
- Close other memory-intensive applications
- Check available RAM

**Model download fails:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify firewall settings
- Ensure sufficient disk space

### Performance Optimization
- **GPU Users**: Set `MODEL_GPU_LAYERS=35` for 3-5x speed improvement
- **CPU Users**: Adjust `MODEL_THREADS` to match your CPU cores
- **Memory**: Close unnecessary applications to free up RAM

## üéØ Architecture

Typify is built with clean architecture principles based on SOLID design patterns, ensuring maintainability, extensibility, and reliable performance.
